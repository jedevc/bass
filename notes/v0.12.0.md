Hi! It's been a while. Accordingly, this is a pretty big release.


## Bass :heart: Dockerfiles

Bet you didn't see that title coming.

Bass can now `(docker-build)` Dockerfiles, and Bass can now be used _in_ a
Dockerfile:

```docker
# syntax = basslang/frontend:dev

(use (*dir*/bass/bass.bass))

(def dist
  (bass:dist *dir* "dev" "linux" "amd64"))

(-> (from (linux/alpine)
      ($ cp dist/bass /usr/local/bin/bass))
    (with-entrypoint ["bass"]))
```

This is all incredibly experimental and you'll need bleeding-edge versions of
everything, but it's a fun proof of concept!

In general it's better to integrate with Dockerfiles than to pretend Bass
exists in a world where it has somehow replaced them. It means you can use Bass
anywhere you can use a Dockerfile, and it means you can be downstream of
projects that use Dockerfiles.


## it'll be all `(write)`

Bass can now `(write)` to host paths:

```clojure
; write a thunk's output to disk
(write (from (linux/alpine) ($ echo "Hello!"))
       ./hello.txt)

; write a path to disk
(use (.git (linux/alpine/git)))
(write git:github/vito/bass/ref/main/README.md
       *dir*/hello.md)
```

After coming back to Bass I noticed I had a confusing blend of inter-dependent
Bash and Bass scripts in my repo. Lots of Bass scripts expected you to pipe
them to `bass --export` and direct that to disk, so a lot of Bass scripts had a
corresponding Bash script for doing just that.

I was hesitant to allow this before, because I liked the idea of Bass being
"pure" and isolated. But if it means writing less Bash, it seems worth it.

Note that you can only write to host paths that the script has access to, so
Bass scripts are still somewhat "pure" in the sense that they can only write to
explicit inputs. (`*dir*/../` will yell at you.)


## share thunks with `(publish)` and `(export)`

Bass can now `(publish)` a thunk directly to a container registry, or you can
`(export)` a thunk to create a "virtual" OCI archive path that you can
`(write)` to disk.

```clojure
(def foo
  (from (linux/alpine)
    ($ touch ./foo)))

; publish to Docker Hub at vito/foo:latest
(publish foo "vito/foo:latest")
; => {:repository "docker.io/vito/foo" :tag "latest" :digest "sha256:60f786f7639880846f853388cd668d95f619749b0086b127ad030dd9fc7dd0a3"}

; write an OCI tarball to disk
(write (export foo) *dir*/image.tar)

; read it, because why not?
(next (read (export foo) :tar))
; => <fs>/blobs/
```

Similar to before, adding these allowed me to delete a few Bash scripts and
write more Bass.


## `ENTRYPOINT` & `CMD` gain some respect

Bass now has `(with-entrypoint)` and `(with-default-args)` for configuring a
container image's ENTRYPOINT and CMD. In addition,

Up until now, Bass has never respected a container's entrypoint or default
command. You could `(from)` it to hop inside, but you couldn't just, you know,
run it.

Now that `(publish)` and `(export)` are directly part of the language, it
seemed only right to also let you configure an `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` if you want to. So now there is `(with

Now you can! To be frank, these two things are kind of confusing to implement,
but I think the semantics are reasonable.


## Dagger runtime is almost prime-time

The Dagger runtime is nearly feature-complete:

* Dagger now has Bass-style services (:flex:), so service thunks work now.

* Dagger can now run thunks loaded from OCI achives.

* Dagger can now run `insecure!` thunks (i.e. privileged builds).

The two remaining feature gaps are TLS and the niche capability to run commands
from cache paths.


## `.git`, you a busta!

You can now `(glob)` paths to prevent uninteresting files from busting caches.

```clojure
(glob *dir* ./**/*.go ./Makefile)
; => <host: .>/?[./**/*.go ./Makefile]

(glob *dir* ./**/*.go ./Makefile ! ./main.go ./std/*.bass)
; => <host: .>/?[./**/*.go ./Makefile ./std/*.bass]![./main.go]
```

This is honestly a pretty huge feature in hindsight since it gives you *much*
more control over when things should be rebuilt. For example, Bass bundles a
shim executable that needs to be built for each platform. It's slow to build
and package, but changes infrequently. I had to resort to `git` specific
trickery to scope its build to its own changes, but now I can just use
`(glob)`!
